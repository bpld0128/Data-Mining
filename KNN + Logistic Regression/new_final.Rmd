## Conclusion
Section 2
Given the dataset, and using the K-nearest neigbors classification approach, for k=3, it can be said that Chris should be given a loan to his application as there are out of 3 neigbors, 2 satisfy the condition and one does not. Therefore, YES, the loan should be given.

Section 3,
After splitting the data, and using the logistic regression, to develop a predictive model, with the cutoff probability of 0.5, the accuracy obtained was 93.26% for the test data set of 210 values.
