# install the relevant library
install.packages("openxlsx")
library(openxlsx)
# Read the data from the workbook
bdata <- readWorkbook("elec.xlsx", sheet = 1)
# View the specified column
# View(bdata$Voltage)

par(mfrow=c(1,3))
# plot histogram for voltage
hist(bdata$Voltage ,main="Voltage Distribution", xlab="Voltage Value", col = "grey")
# plot box plot for voltage
boxplot(bdata$Voltage, main="Voltage Distribution", ylab = "Voltage Value", col = "grey")
# plot Q-Q plot for voltage
qqnorm(bdata$Voltage, main = "Q-Q Plot for Voltage", col = "grey")
qqline(bdata$Voltage)

```
CONCLUSIONS:
From the above plots, it can be interpreted that-
1) from the 2880 observations, around 2000+ samples are between 238-242 voltage level, which means that the data is pretty stable
2) box plot implies the uniformity of the data,such that the median lies nearly in between the ranged values
3) QQ plot for voltage implies that the obtained values are linear with the theoretical values, except at the lower and higher ends.
